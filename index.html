I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, and recently started learning JavaScript and Node.js. Today, I’m excited to share what I’ve learned, the challenges I’ve faced, and the projects I’ve built along the way.
  </p>
  <p class="mb-6">First, I started with HTML, which is like the skeleton of a website. It defines the structure — things like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Learning how to use semantic HTML properly was really important because it helps both browsers and people understand the content better.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">Next, I learned CSS;the language that makes websites look good. I explored different ways to apply CSS: inline styles, internal stylesheets, and external stylesheets. I also got familiar with concepts like the box model, Flexbox, and CSS Grid, which helped me design layouts that are both clean and flexible.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">To speed up styling, I learned Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Instead of writing lots of custom CSS, Tailwind lets you apply small, reusable classes directly in the HTML. This made my workflow faster and my code more consistent. It was great for building responsive, mobile-friendly designs quickly.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">Speaking of responsiveness, I learned how to make websites look good on any device — whether it’s a phone, tablet, or desktop. Using media queries, I adapted layouts to different screen sizes, practicing mobile-first design to ensure a smooth user experience across the board.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">Then, I was introduced to JavaScript — the programming language that adds interactivity to websites. I learned about variables, functions, and events, like responding to a button click. JavaScript opened up a whole new world where I can create dynamic, user-friendly interfaces.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">Along with JavaScript, I learned how to install and use Node.js. This lets me run JavaScript outside the browser, which is key for backend development. It was exciting to set up the environment and get a glimpse of how full-stack development works</p>
  <p class="mb-6">To manage my projects, I started using Git and GitHub. Git helps me track changes in my code, and GitHub lets me share my projects online. This was really useful for keeping my work organized and getting comfortable with version control — a critical skill in real-world development.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">To practice, we were given challenges from Frontend Mentor, where I built real UI components based on design mockups. I also used Figma to understand design and translate it into code. These experiences helped me improve my problem-solving skills and attention to detail</p>
  <p class="mb-6">So far, I’ve built a personal portfolio website, several responsive landing pages, and shared all my projects on GitHub. This portfolio not only showcases what I’ve learned but also acts as a platform to apply new skills continuously.</p>
  <p class="mb-6">Moving forward, I plan to deepen my JavaScript knowledge. I’ll also learn more advanced GitHub workflows like branching and pull requests. Finally, I’m excited to dive deeper into backend development using Node.js and Express.</p>
